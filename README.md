# HoudiniSolarisUtilityKit
Python tools for HoudiniFX, with a focus on Solaris and USD

## Current Tools
Auto setup Solaris scene by importing everything from the obj level
Auto generate a Karma Material from a folder of Texture files



### Roadmap
Will recieve continual development as I get more time. This was initially made for a university project but I want to continue it further


**Polish Auto Material's user experience**
- Refine windows into 1 seemless usage
- Import and setup the geo to go along side the material and link them
Create a system for USD atuo scene export
